		<h1> Welcome to My Future Outlooks page!</h1>
		 
		<img src="images\future.jpg" alt="Sign that Reads Future Ahead" />
		 <p> Have always been a big dreamer and sometimes I tend to be more imaginative than realistic. 
		 I have a lot of plans for my life and here I will share thoes dreams of my life out of highschool with you. </p> 
		
		
		<h2> 1. Filmmaker! </h2>
		 <p>As I have said, I have always been a dreamer, and becoming a filmmaker is my biggest goal in life. I have always loved to share 
		 peoples stories and I want my career to be fulfilling an impact not just Cayman, but the world. </p>

		 <h2> 2. Humanitarian Efforts </h2>
		 <p> I really love to help people. Other than film, another one of my passions is learning new cultures. Being Humanitarian combines these two factors. 
		 I feel that if I'm successful, everyone else should have the opportunity to be successful. If we are going to be a peaceful world, we need to help each other.</p>

		<h2> 3. Travel the Globe </h2>
		 <p> I love to travel. In my life I have been to six different countries and seven states within the US. I have also been to Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. 
		 This love ties in with my other passions very nicely. You need money to travel, and as a Filmmaker and a Humanitarian you have to travel a lot.</p>

		<h2> 4. Make Money!</h2>
		 <p> Like everyone else I do aspire to make money and live a very comfortable life. But, I mostly don't want to make money for myself. Money
		does run the world and I want to help tons of charities and people around the world. </p>

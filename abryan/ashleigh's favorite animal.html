<br>

<p>The morpho butterflies comprise many species of Neotropical butterfly under the genus Morpho. This genus includes over 29 accepted species and 147 accepted subspecies, found mostly in South America, Mexico, and Central America.<br>
The blue morpho is among the largest butterflies in the world, with wings spanning from five to eight inches. <br>
Their vivid, iridescent blue coloring is a result of the microscopic scales on the backs of their wings, which reflect light.<br>
This butterfly is my favorite because when it is a caterpillar it is very dull and ugly and you would never thing to touch it but then it transforms into this beautiful butterfly that everyone loves. It just teaches so many valuabke lessons on not to judge and to treat everyone equally because on the inside we are all beautiful butterflies.</p>

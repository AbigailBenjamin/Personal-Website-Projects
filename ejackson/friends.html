<p> These girls are very importnat to Elizabeth she's known them for as long as she can remeber! 
They have all been through so much together. They're all so different, Elizabeth would describe Monina, 
pictured on the far left, to be the mom of the group as she always goes the extra mile to make sure the 
rest of us are good. Kassi is the planner of the group as she always organizes sleepovers, parties and 
other get-togethers we have. She describes her self to me the baby of the group and Denise is the grandma 
of the group, always tired and hungry!</p>
